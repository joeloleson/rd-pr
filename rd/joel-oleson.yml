  ## Bio
  Joel played a pivotal role in the success of Microsoft SharePoint as the first full time dedicated employee hired by Microsoft IT

  Joel was Senior Technical Product Manager for SharePoint in 2007 managing the IT audience. Since his time at Microsoft 10 years ago
  he's focused on evangelizing intranet and collaboration solutions while growing and connecting the global technology community 
  traveling to diverse places sharing technology, inspiring and transforming lives in his quest to connect and build communities
  around the world.  He has a handful of countries left, but that won't slow him down.  He is frequently recognized in the industry as top
  blogger and influencer in IT circles especially around Intranets, SharePoint & Office 365.  
  
  
  When not traveling you can find him in Southern California walking along the pier in Oceanside with his wife or one of his three boys or
